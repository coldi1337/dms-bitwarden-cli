//  3. It always drains its stdin. `tee` writes to this branch; a branch that

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Array.isArray is not safe on anything that came back out of QML
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `bw`'s JSON parses into real arrays, and every check below used to say
// Array.isArray(). That holds right up until the parsed cipher is stored in a
// QML `var` property -- root.items -- and read back out to build the detail
// view. Qt converts the nested arrays on that round trip into array-like
// objects: `typeof` is "object", `.length` is right, indexing works, and
// Array.isArray() returns false. So the check passes in Node and fails in the
// panel, silently, yielding an empty list rather than an error.
//
// That is exactly how an item the list had already marked as having twelve
// attachments opened with no attachments section at all -- and, it turns out,
// why the detail view's WEBSITE section has been empty for logins that
// plainly have a URI.
//
// Duck-type instead: anything with a sane numeric length is a list.
//
// Bounded, because duck-typing takes the server's word for how long the list
// is. `{"attachments":{"length":200000000}}` is forty bytes of JSON that asked
// for a two-hundred-million-element array, and the process that dies of it is
// the whole shell -- bar, panel and all. The item-list byte cap is no defence
// here: the lie costs the server nothing to tell. No item carries thousands of
// URIs, attachments or custom fields, so past the ceiling there is no list
