# Bitwarden for DankMaterialShell

A Bitwarden and Vaultwarden plugin for DankMaterialShell, maintained by [coldi1337](https://github.com/coldi1337). Based on [Elevate08/qs-bitwarden-cli](https://github.com/Elevate08/qs-bitwarden-cli) by David Spencer. MIT licensed.

Search, copy and manage a Bitwarden or Vaultwarden vault directly in a Quickshell panel. The official `bw` CLI performs vault operations. The plugin supports logins, secure notes, cards, identities, TOTP, folders, organizations, the password generator, Bitwarden Send and an optional SSH agent.

## Requirements

- DankMaterialShell **1.6.0 or newer** and Quickshell.
- The official Bitwarden CLI (`bw`) and `jq`.
- `wl-copy` from `wl-clipboard` for clipboard operations.
- A running Secret Service provider (for example `gnome-keyring`) and `secret-tool` for remembering sessions, PIN and fingerprint unlock. Installing `libsecret` alone provides only the client, not a keyring service.
- `gdbus` and `systemd-inhibit` for the suspend monitor.
- An enrolled fingerprint and DMS's `assets/pam/fprint` configuration for fingerprint unlock.

The setup screen identifies missing required dependencies. On Arch, its install action opens a terminal and runs `sudo pacman -S --needed` for the selected packages. On other distributions, install the named packages with the distribution's package manager.

## Installation

Install directly from this repository while the DMS registry submission is pending:

```sh
mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/DankMaterialShell/plugins"
git clone --branch dms-port https://github.com/coldi1337/dms-bitwarden-cli.git \
  "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/DankMaterialShell/plugins/bitwarden"
dms ipc call plugin-scan scan
dms ipc call plugins enable bitwarden
```

Then add **Bitwarden** to your DankBar layout in DMS settings. If the destination already exists, update that installation instead of cloning over it.

To update a clean installation:

```sh
git -C "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/DankMaterialShell/plugins/bitwarden" pull --ff-only
dms restart
```

Restarting DMS loads updated QML imports and locks the plugin's active vault. Your CLI account remains signed in.

## Sign in and use the vault

Click the shield/lock icon in DankBar. Choose US, EU, or a custom server URL for Vaultwarden. The panel supports email/password, two-factor challenges and API-key login. Its terminal-login action delegates interactive login prompts to `bw`.

Common shortcuts while the item list is focused:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Search |
| Up / Down, `j` / `k` | Select an item |
| Enter | Copy password, or open a non-login item |
| `u` | Copy username |
| `m` | Copy TOTP code |
| `e` | Open details / edit |
| `f`, `o`, `t` | Folder, organization and type filters |
| `g` | Password generator |
| `n` | New item |
| `s` | Settings |
| `r` | Sync |
| `l` | Lock |
| Escape | Back / clear search / close |

While typing in the search field, Alt plus the corresponding key runs a shortcut. Password copies use `wl-copy --sensitive`; the configurable clipboard timer clears them. The optional TOTP follow-up can replace a copied password with its current TOTP.

Right-clicking the bar icon locks an unlocked vault, or opens a locked vault. Both horizontal and vertical bars are supported. A single daemon owns the vault and IPC, shared by every bar, so multiple monitors do not create competing sessions.

## Fingerprint unlock

The DMS port uses the **same fingerprint-only PAM configuration as DMS's lock screen**:

```
<active DMS shell directory>/assets/pam/fprint
```

No Omarchy PAM service or additional `/etc/pam.d` file is needed. The setup probe checks this configuration and an enrolled finger. Fingerprint verification is performed by Quickshell's PAM integration and `pam_fprintd`.

1. Unlock the vault normally.
2. Open the plugin's settings, then **Security → Unlock with fingerprint**.
3. Enter the Bitwarden master password in the plugin's setup form once.
4. Lock and reopen the vault, then touch the sensor.

If saving the master password reports that the OS keyring is unavailable, install/start a Secret Service provider and create or unlock its default keyring. The keyring password belongs in the desktop prompt, not in this plugin. Automatic keyring unlock at desktop login depends on the session/PAM configuration; fingerprint enrollment alone does not unlock the keyring.

Fingerprint unlock is **off by default**. Enabling it stores the master password in the OS keyring: PAM verifies the finger, and the plugin retrieves that password to run `bw unlock`. Anyone who can read the unlocked keyring can therefore read the stored master password. Disabling the feature or logging out removes this stored copy. The master password is never a DMS preference or repository file.

PIN unlock remains a separate optional feature. Its existing upstream implementation stores a PIN-encrypted master password in the keyring; a short PIN has a limited search space.

## Settings and locking

Use the settings screen inside the panel, or the **Open Bitwarden settings** button in DMS's plugin settings.

Non-secret preferences are stored through DMS `PluginService`, under the `bitwarden` key in:

```
~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugin_settings.json
```

Defaults include a 15-minute vault timeout, locking with the desktop and on suspend, and a 30-second clipboard timeout. The port follows DMS `IdleService.isShellLocked` immediately and retains an IPC lock-state poll. The original suspend inhibitor and secret/session cleanup remain in place.

Vault data and account configuration belong to the official Bitwarden CLI. Session handoff files use `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/qs-bitwarden-cli`; learned non-secret application associations use `~/.local/state/qs-bitwarden-cli`. The original keyring service name is retained. Do not run this port and the Omarchy version against the same session simultaneously.

## IPC and shortcuts

```sh
dms ipc call bitwarden toggle
dms ipc call bitwarden open
dms ipc call bitwarden close
dms ipc call bitwarden settings
dms ipc call bitwarden lock
dms ipc call bitwarden sync
dms ipc call bitwarden status
dms ipc call bitwarden sshAgentStatus
```

Bind `dms ipc call bitwarden toggle` in your compositor's shortcut configuration. The daemon works even when the bar widget is absent. With a bar present, the panel follows the focused screen's widget.

## Optional SSH agent

The upstream SSH helper, approval screens and key-handling code are retained. The agent is disabled by default. The bundled x86-64 helper is checksum-checked by the existing implementation. Its tests also build the source locally and exercise real signing pipelines.

See [the SSH-agent guide](docs/ssh-agent.md) for the original protocol and routing details. That guide and demo scripts still contain upstream Omarchy commands; use the DMS IPC commands above for this port. Live fingerprint and SSH signing depend on the local device/keyring and the user's own activation; automated tests use disposable keys.

## Development

For a development checkout, link the repository into DMS instead of cloning into its plugin directory. Run this from the checkout, with no existing `bitwarden` installation at the destination:

```sh
mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/DankMaterialShell/plugins"
ln -s "$PWD" "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/DankMaterialShell/plugins/bitwarden"
dms ipc call plugin-scan scan
dms ipc call plugins enable bitwarden
```

Run the automated checks with Rust/Cargo, Node.js and Qt 6's `qmltestrunner` installed:

```sh
bash tests/run.sh
```

The runner builds the SSH helper with its locked Cargo dependencies, runs the Node test files, and executes QtTest checks for keyboard handling, text rendering, layout and SSH models. It does not need your real vault credentials.

`plugin.json` is the DMS manifest. `manifest.json` is retained as the upstream settings-schema reference used by existing tests, not as a second DMS entry point.

- `Panel.qml`: one daemon containing the vault state and panel.
- `BarWidget.qml`: native DMS bar component, forwarding to that daemon.
- `DmsUi/`: MIT controls adapted from Omarchy, with DMS theme and popout bindings.
- `BitwardenModel.js`: original CLI/model logic with DMS host commands.

Reload after ordinary edits:

```sh
dms ipc call plugin-scan reload bitwarden
```

DMS reloads the entry component with a cache-busting URL, but imported QML/JavaScript may remain cached. After changing imported controls or the model, restart DMS to load the complete new version. Reloading/removing the daemon locks its active vault; the CLI account stays signed in.

## Uninstall

Turn off PIN/fingerprint storage or log out in the panel first if you want to remove its stored credentials. Then disable the plugin:

```sh
dms ipc call plugins disable bitwarden
```

Remove its DankBar widget and the `bitwarden` folder from `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/DankMaterialShell/plugins`. For a development installation, remove only the symlink to keep your checkout. Run `dms ipc call plugin-scan scan` afterward.

Removing the plugin folder does not remove the official CLI's account data.
